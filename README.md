<h1>Basic Calculator</h1>
Just a basic and simple calculator with the basic functions and stuff like that

There's a possibility that there will be more functions to this (similar to a Scientific Calculator) 

but that's just maybe cause this is just a basic thing that I wanted to work on to enhance my ability to do math in JS.

<h2>Functions and features:</h2>
• Animation on button press


• Click sound on button press


• Of course the basic functions of a calculator


• Cool design in my opinion


• Scientific functions as well.
