<h1>Basic Calculator</h1>
Just a basic and simple calculator with the basic functions and stuff like that

There's a possibility that there will be more functions to this (similar to a Scientific Calculator) 

but that's just maybe cause this is just a basic thing that I wanted to work on to enhance my ability to do math in JS.
